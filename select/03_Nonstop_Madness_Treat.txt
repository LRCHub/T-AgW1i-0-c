You can say that I'm a simple drone
In love, gone insane
But when I step out of my comfort zone
I'm a runaway train

My heart is bleeding, pounding
Like a hand grenade
Hold it and pull the pin

Tell me

What have I done to deserve this
No no no non stop, ma ma ma madness
Where every cut is the deepest
No no no non stop, ma ma ma madness
Won't settle for less, ma ma ma madness
Don't settle for less, ma ma ma madness

I got a taste, wanna play the game
The master of suspense
Around the clock, is my middle name
It doesn't make no sense

My world is turning,
Feels like I'm burning up within
Can't stop him, my evil twin

Tell me

What have I done to deserve this...
