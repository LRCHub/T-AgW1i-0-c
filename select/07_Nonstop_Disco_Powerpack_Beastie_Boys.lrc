[00:23.50] Well, how you feeling, Ad-Rock?
[00:24.81] Well, I'm feeling well
[00:25.97] Bonafide, qualified, with a story to tell
[00:28.36] Well, how you feeling, Mike D?
[00:29.83] Well, I feel all good
[00:30.75] All day is how we play in the neighborhood
[00:33.12] Well, how you feeling, MCA?
[00:34.39] Well, I feel right
[00:35.65] I speak my words on the track 'cause the track sounds tight
[00:38.01] Well, if you're feeling good and you're feeling right
[00:40.36] Uh, somebody step up and grab the mic
[00:42.77] Hello everybody and how you been?
[00:45.36] It's Ad-Rock rappin' on the microphone again
[00:47.59] I got grace, class, style, finesse, and debonair
[00:50.01] Murdalize motherfuckers 'cause I just don't care
[00:52.46] The Emcee Whisperer, kinda like a trainer
[00:54.90] I take sucker rappers, I put 'em through a strainer
[00:57.46] Like macaroni 'cause the shit sound cheesy
[00:59.88] Watch how it's done, boy, it looks easy
[01:02.29] Nonstop, going off, kingpin, microphone boss
[01:04.99] Do my own thing you, can't afford the cost
[01:07.23] Of my style, take you through a turnstile
[01:09.42] 'Cause I'm live and direct, and I'm wicked and wild
[01:11.64] Because I'm back on a roll, got total control
[01:14.08] I flow like the water out your toiler bowl
[01:16.57] Your style is cheap, boy, just like a Dutch
[01:18.98] You know you're not smokin' on the microphone much
[01:21.39] There's a certain special talent that I never lack
[01:23.81] Huh-ha, huh-ha, and that's a fact
[01:26.15] 'Cause we shine like the chrome on a Cadillac
[01:28.54] You better break a wishbone 'cause we never wack
[01:31.20] Said we're never that and that is that
[01:33.45] And we're the nonstop disco powerpack
[01:35.88] Uh, that's right, we go all night
[01:38.65] Who gonna be next to bless the mic?
[01:40.87] Now this it the way we run it down
[01:43.04] We're gettin' you high on the funky sounds
[01:45.63] This is the way we get it on
[01:47.89] B-Boys in the house 'til the break of dawn
[01:50.53] See, I mix my style up like a cement mixer
[01:52.81] Smooth and fix ya, like a rhyme elixir
[01:55.09] "Yo-yo, sound man, make Mike's mic louder"
[01:57.75] Don't make me sound cheap like a box of douche powder
[02:00.10] I max and relax, champagne mojito
[02:02.56] Don't go commando, don't know bandito
[02:04.79] Je m'appelle Michel Perignon
[02:07.16] Me and Claude in the chateau, we got it going on
[02:09.63] Quincy's in the hot tub like it's '73
[02:11.97] Looking over his shoulder and he's looking at me
[02:14.31] I'm all white in the face, towel around my waist
[02:16.86] What's up with that watch inside that glass case?
[02:19.45] I got to make my move, sneak out the place
[02:21.63] Undetected, not leaving a trace
[02:23.94] Party's done, microphone's wrecked
[02:26.41] Wines been drunk and heads been checked
[02:28.64] I see one last profiterole and make my play
[02:31.03] And pass the microphone to MCA
[02:33.54] Nonstop, on the top, and you clock, when we rock
[02:36.21] Never fakin', no mistakin', we be makin' hip hop
[02:38.35] So come on everybody, get down, yeah
[02:43.22] Now it's a spot check, hit the deck, count down
[02:45.39] 'Cause I'ma break it down for you how we run it down
[02:47.73] Pound for pound, keep the bass lines round
[02:50.15] I seen you watchin', clockin', jockin' my sound
[02:52.51] But, for real, I been glad I grew up in hip hop
[02:55.06] Still got mad love for a record called "Beat Bop"
[02:57.63] It meant a lot spinning on my Walkman
[02:59.99] Shout out to the African Bam
[03:02.00] And to the S to the P the double O-N-Y
[03:04.40] The one MC who you can't deny
[03:06.95] I'd listen to the records and they'd inspire
[03:09.36] Sit down to write and the pen breathes fire
[03:11.72] Construct a rhyme with specific intent
[03:14.01] Flowin' from and brain cells right to my pen
[03:16.34] And then I put the book down, grab ahold the mic
[03:18.69] Words flowin' so cold, turn water to ice
[03:21.19] Come through the wire, saturate the tape
[03:23.59] You put me in the mix, nice it up with the plate
[03:26.01] And then they press it on wax, sell it in the store
[03:28.49] The DJ spin the record out on the dance floor
[03:30.98] Comin' through the speaker to shake your eardrum
[03:33.15] Brain cells get lit, then you hear where we're comin' from
[03:35.40] Well, Ad-Rock (huh), get it on
[03:37.87] We gonna rock the house until the break of dawn
[03:40.06] Mike D (huh), get it on
[03:42.47] We gonna rock the house until the break of dawn
[03:45.05] MCA (a-yeah), get it on
[03:47.44] We gonna rock the house until the break of dawn
[03:49.70] Beastie Boys in the house, don't stop
