Hey!

I'm gonna rise,
When the daylight's low,
All dressed to kill,
And all systems go,
You're be staring on my late night show!

Sure you can run, but you'll be too slow,
I need to tell you that I told you so,
Well that's a lie, but I know you know!

After stroke of midnight it's the hunting season,
I'll go on instinct time I need no reason
I'm driven crazy by this angel prey,
But I won't let you get away!

I'm a serpent in heat,
And I'm hungry for meat,
I constrict and bite,
Non-Stop Nite!
I'm the cannibal rasc,
Sea king fangs in your flesh,
Say bye bye light,
It's Non-Stop Nite!

Oh, oh
Nonstop Nite!

Oh, oh,
Nonstop Nite!

Wow!

I have to quit because the sun comes up,
That's a good news for you, now guess what,
I blocked the door so never window shot,
I'll smash the clocks and the time will freeze,
Crack out the nitro, keep you on your knees.

I will have have fun for eternity!

After stroke of midnight it's the hunting season,

I constrict and bite,
Non-Stop Nite!
I'm the cannibal rasc,
Sea king fangs in your flesh,
Say bye bye light,
It's Non-Stop Nite!

Whoooa, whoooa!
Nonstop nite!
Whoooa, whoooa!
Nonstop nite!
