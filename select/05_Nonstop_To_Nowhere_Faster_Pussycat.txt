I'm on the lame train
I got a first-class ticket on the nonstop to nowhere
Where it takes me I don't know
I guess the tracks you lay are your own
I'm on the lame train
I'm on the lame train
Well it's 5 o'clock in the mornin'
And I can't fall asleep again
Times are changin' and movin' real fast
Way too fast for me
Seems like only yesterday I was skipping school and stealing gasoline
I've been talking
I guess you call it talking a white lie
One minute I'm on top of the world and the next thing you know
I'm on the lame train
I got a first-class ticket on the nonstop to nowhere
Where it takes me I don't know
I guess the track you lay are your own
I'm on the lame train
I got a first-class ticket on the nonstop to nowhere
Where it takes me I don't know
Nonstop to nowhere
Sometimes I just sit and daydream
And I just slip away from here
If only I had a crystal ball
Or could invent a time machine
I'd go into the future take a good look around
And see what life has in store for me
I've been walking I guess you call it walking a thin line
One minute I'm on top of the world and the next thing you know
I'm on the lame train
I got a first-class ticket on the nonstop to nowhere
Where it takes me I don't know
I guess the tracks you lay are your own
It's like a chain gang
I know the exit but my problems seem to follow me wherever I go
Nonstop to nowhere
I don't believe the preachers they're just sticking out their hands
I don't believe the government and who the hell's this Uncle Sam?
Mr. Conductor will you help me off this train?
Well I believe I'm on the wrong one and it's taking me down the drain
I'm on the lame train
I got a first-class ticket on the nonstop to nowhere
Where it takes me I don't know
I guess the tracks you lay are your own
I'm on the lame train
I got a first class ticket on the nonstop to nowhere
It's all carved right in stone (Nonstop to nowhere)
I guess the tracks you lay are your own
I'm on the lame train
I got a first-class ticket on the nonstop to nowhere
Where it takes me I don't know
I guess the tracks you lay are your own
It's like a chain gang
I know the exit but my problems seem to follow me wherever I go
Nonstop to nowhere
Where it takes me I don't know
I guess the tracks you lay are your own
Where it takes me I don't know
I guess the tracks you lay are your own
Your own
The tracks you lay are your own
Where it takes me I don't know
I guess the tracks you lay are your own
Your own
The tracks you lay are your own
